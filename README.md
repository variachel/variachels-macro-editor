# Variachel's Macro Editor

This module alters the styling of the macro editor. 

The editor window is larger by default, however the size can be selected 
from within module settings.

It also enhances the operation of the editor itself:

- Syntax highlighting
- Preserves indentation on a new line
- Adds closing brackets, quotes
- Indents lines and blocks with the Tab key and unindents using Shift-Tab
- A block comment hot key can be bound in keyboard controls, which toggles the selected line(s) between commented and uncommented

The editor itself is based on [CodeJar](https://github.com/antonmedv/codejar) with some extensions.

Based on the original code by Tero Parvinen @ https://github.com/teroparvinen/foundry-improved-macro-editor
